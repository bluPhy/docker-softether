## 2025-05-24 - [Shell Script Quoting and Loop logic]
**Vulnerability:** Weak password handling and incomplete command execution in entrypoint script. Unquoted variables caused passwords with spaces to be truncated. A `read` loop reading from a Here String (`<<<`) only executed once because it consumed the entire string as one line, failing to iterate over array elements if not handled correctly.
**Learning:** Shell scripts require careful handling of whitespace and special characters. `read` without `-r` and unquoted variables are common pitfalls. Here Strings (`<<<`) are single-line inputs unless the variable contains newlines; array reading (`read -a`) populates the array but the loop body must iterate over that array manually if the intention is to process list elements.
**Prevention:** Always use `read -r`. Always quote variables. When processing lists in shell, verify if you are iterating over lines or array elements. Use `set -f` when expanding unquoted strings that might contain wildcards.
